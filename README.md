# MyCoachSportTest

Here is my test about Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

You can play versus a bot or make two bots fight each other. You can restart a game every time one is done. All the bots choosing signs are random.

I chose SwiftUI as a challenge because I've done some technology watch on this.

About the design pattern, it's an MVVM pattern with a model and a viewModel that manipulate data for the views.

I have test my viewModel functions and my UIViews.

The model is quite extensible, we can easily add more signs by adding more case in enum Signs and add his win and lose match up.

Thank you for this fun test :)
